# DeepCV
Deep Computer Vision workshop and training material

## Prerequisites
These notebooks are intended to be run on GPUs so we need to either have a laptop with an Nvidia GPU, and CUDA + TensorFlow GPU installed, or we have to set up a GPU cloud (Paperspace/Google colab/Kaggle etc).

### 1. Running locally
If you have a laptop with an Nvidia GPU, follow these instructions. Install [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) on your laptop. Check the website for installation instructions. You should now be able to run the notebook as it is.

(Remaining instructions to follow shortly)
### 2. Running on Kaggle

### 3. Running on Paperspace

### 4. Running on Google Cloud
